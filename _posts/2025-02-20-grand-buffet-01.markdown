Using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), I designed a series of generative art pieces composed of simple geometric shapes making a variety of patterns. Like all generative art, each piece is uniquely generated, ensuring no two outputs are the same. This particular iteration, [#146](https://www.fxhash.xyz/gentk/KT1U6EHmNxJTkvaWJ4ThczG4FSDaHC21ssvi-1352181) out of 365, is one of my personal favorites due to its balance and elegant simplicity.

This serves as a brief introduction to the project. Stay tuned for a future post where Iâ€™ll delve into the full design process and the reasoning behind it. More insights coming soon!
