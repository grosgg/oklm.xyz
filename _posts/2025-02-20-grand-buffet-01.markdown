Grand Buffet is a generative art project I created to celebrate the first anniversary of the [fxhash.xyz](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/grand-buffet) platform.

Using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), I designed a series of intricate patterns composed of simple geometric shapes. Like all generative art, each piece is uniquely generated, ensuring no two outputs are the same. This particular iteration, [#146](https://www.fxhash.xyz/gentk/KT1U6EHmNxJTkvaWJ4ThczG4FSDaHC21ssvi-1352181) out of 365, is one of my personal favorites due to its harmonious balance and elegant simplicity.
