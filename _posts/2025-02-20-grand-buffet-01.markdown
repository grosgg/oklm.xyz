Grand Buffet is a generative art project I developed to celebrate the first anniversary of [fxhash.xyz](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/grand-buffet), a platform dedicated to generative art. It’s a tribute to the platform’s creative community, blending algorithmic patterns and playful design to mirror the experimentation and collaboration that define fxhash.

Using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), I designed a series of patterns composed of simple geometric shapes. Like all generative art, each piece is uniquely generated, ensuring no two outputs are the same. This particular iteration, [#146](https://www.fxhash.xyz/gentk/KT1U6EHmNxJTkvaWJ4ThczG4FSDaHC21ssvi-1352181) out of 365, is one of my personal favorites due to its balance and elegant simplicity.

This serves as a brief introduction to the project. Stay tuned for a future post where I’ll delve into the full design process and the reasoning behind it. More insights coming soon!
