<p class="caption">I think this should work.</p>

My bedroom’s pretty small, and I sleep on a futon mattress. Every morning, I have to fold up the whole setup and shove it into a corner since it won’t fit in the closet. Honestly, I’m so over dealing with the zero space and constant hassle, so I sketched out a Murphy bed design that should (fingers crossed) fit the room better. Planning to do a deeper dive once I actually start building the thing.
